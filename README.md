# Supervised Learning 
- Supervised learning provides us with a powerful tool to classify and process data using machine language. With supervised learning we use labeled data, which is a data set that has been classified, to infer a learning algorithm. The data set is used as the basis for predicting the classification of other unlabeled data through the use of machine learning algorithms.
- In this regression task I predicted the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.

# Unsupervised Learning
- Unsupervised machine learning algorithms infer patterns from a dataset without reference to known, or labeled, outcomes. Unlike supervised machine learning, unsupervised machine learning methods cannot be directly applied to a regression or a classification problem because you have no idea what the values for the output data might be, making it impossible for you to train the algorithm the way you normally would. Unsupervised learning can instead be used to discover the underlying structure of the data.
- From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, I predicted the optimum number of clusters and represented it visually.

# Exploratory Data Analysis
- Exploratory Data Analysis refers to the critical process of performing initial investigations on data so as to discover patterns, to spot anomalies, to test hypothesis and to check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations.
- I have performed Exploratory Data Analysis on the uploaded dataset Global Terrorism.

# Decision Tree Learning
- Decision Tree algorithm belongs to the family of supervised learning algorithms. Unlike other supervised learning algorithms, the decision tree algorithm can be used for solving regression and classification problems too. The goal of using a Decision Tree is to create a training model that can use to predict the class or value of the target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from prior data (training data). In Decision Trees, for predicting a class label for a record we start from the root of the tree. We compare the values of the root attribute with the record’s attribute. On the basis of comparison, we follow the branch corresponding to that value and jump to the next node.
- For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, I created the Decision Tree classifier and visualized it graphically. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
